        With a career spanning more than 25 years, it is difficult to present all the facets of my chosen work path. The
        picture portfolio that follows is the best representation of the various disciplines that I have mastered as a
        handyman. They run the gamut from a simple sink installation to building an entire home.
        In all instances, I have made an effort to keep my customers “in the loop”, letting them know when I have
        reached a milestone in the project or to consult with them in reference to any needs that they might require.
